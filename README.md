# Confidence-Aware Medical Image Classification using Deep Ensembles

> **Project | Machine Learning / Deep Learning**  
> *CPU-efficient, confidence-aware ensemble framework for medical image classification*

---

## Overview

This project presents a **lightweight, confidence-aware deep learning framework** for medical image classification, designed specifically for **resource-constrained environments**.  
The system integrates **deep feature extraction**, **classical machine learning ensembles**, and an **entropy-based rejection mechanism** to improve reliability and trustworthiness in medical decision support systems.

The project is implemented as part of the **MTech Computer Science and Engineering** curriculum and is aligned with core Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts.

## Key Contributions

- ✅ Pretrained CNN-based feature extraction (EfficientNet-B0)
- ✅ Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- ✅ Hybrid ensemble of classical ML classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel)
  - Gradient Boosting
- ✅ Confidence-aware **rejection mechanism** using entropy
- ✅ **5-fold stratified cross-validation**
- ✅ Mean ROC curve analysis
- ✅ Fully **CPU-only**, no specialized hardware required
- ✅ Reproducible and modular codebase

## Dataset

Publicly available **Chest X-ray Tuberculosis datasets**:

- **Montgomery County CXR Dataset**
- **Shenzhen Hospital CXR Dataset**

The datasets are automatically downloaded and organized using `kagglehub`.  
Images are labeled using strict filename-based ground truth (`_0.png` → Normal, `_1.png` → TB).

> ⚠️ Raw datasets are excluded from this repository due to size constraints.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/megha-ranjith/medical_image_classification_dl.git
cd medical_image_classification_dl
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run
### Step 1: Prepare Dataset
```bash
python prepare_data.py
```
This will:
- Download datasets
- Organize images into NORMAL and TB classes

### Step 2: Run Main Pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```
This performs:
- Feature extraction
- PCA
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Rejection-based evaluation
- ROC curve plotting

##  Outputs
After execution, the following artifacts are generated:

## Results Tables
```bash
results/tables/final_results_5fold.csv
```
Includes:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- AUC
- Coverage

## 📊 Plots

```

## Evaluation Methodology

- Stratified 5-fold cross-validation
- Metrics computed only on accepted predictions
- Coverage reported to quantify abstention behavior
- ROC curves averaged across folds
- This ensures robust, leakage-free evaluation.
